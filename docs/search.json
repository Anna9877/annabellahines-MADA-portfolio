    "text": "Background Info:\nMy name is Annabella Hines and I am a first year master of public health(MPH) student with a concentration in epidemiology. I graduated in December 2020 from UGA with my undergraduate degree in Biology with an emphasis in marine sciences. I then worked in a dermatopathology lab for approximately two years before returning to UGA to pursue my MPH this past fall. My main interests are in environmental epidemiology and vector borne diseases, but I’m eager to expand my knowledge in new and unexpected areas. My undergraduate research involved surveying Georgia for an invasive tick species and cataloging specimens and environmental data. Last semester I took the introduction to coding in R course and I have some general experience in STATA and SAS. In this course, my goals are to gain knowledge in Git, hone my skills in R, and become more well versed in the tools available for data analysis.\nQuick Picture…\n\n\n\nI’m legally obligated to throw a peace sign in every photo.\n\n\nFun Facts:\n\nI have shown and competed in dog sports for about 10 years!\nI’m obsessed with musicals of all kinds.\nI love to crochet(but I’m not very good at it yet).\n\nCool/Interesting Video:\nI am a big fan of TEDTalks, so when I came across this one I just had to watch it. Sebastian Wernicke analyzed the data available on the popularity of various talks and breaks down how to formulate the ultimate TEDTalk, from topic to color scheme and everything in between. It is about a decade old, but it is a fun watch and I hope you all found it as interesting as I did!"

    "text": "Introduction\nThis data is from the CDC website at https://data.cdc.gov/Foodborne-Waterborne-and-Related-Diseases/Botulism/66i6-hisz and has counts of confirmed botulism cases in the United States by state, year, type of botulism toxin, and transmission type. I will be cleaning an working with all 5 variables.\nChange to Factors\nBotType and ToxinType are both classified as characters but would be better represented as factors so I will change them.\nRename Columns\nNext, I think the BotType and ToxinType variables can be renamed to be a little clearer.\nCheck for Missing Data\nRemove NAs\nAll the NA entries appear to be in the state column. There are 2280 observations so I decided to just remove the 34 NA values since they don’t make up a large percentage of the data overall.\nSave as RDS file"

Toxins A, B, E, and Unknown seem to be the most prevelant types, so I want to focus in on them\n\nSubset for specific toxins\n\nABE<-AKbotulism%>%\n  filter(`Toxin Type` %in% c(\"A\", \"B\", \"E\", \"Unknown\"))\n\nLet’s try that again:\nGrouped by Transmission Type\n\nggplot()+\n  geom_line(aes(x=Year, y=Count, group = `Transmission Type`), data=ABE, alpha = 0.35)+\n  facet_wrap(.~`Toxin Type`) + \n  theme_bw()\n\n\n\n\nAwesome, now we can start to see the patterns and the ranges better among the data. It seems that Type A is popular and only continues to grow in prevalence. B seems to as well though on a smaller scale. I’m not really sure what’s going on with E, and the number of unknown seems to be decreasing. This may be because these cases are becoming better identified and may account for some of the increase in A and B types (all right around 1975).\nWhile I grouped by Transmission Type to better see the data, that grouping isn’t telling us much at the moments, so let’s see if there’s any patterns within it.\n\nggplot()+\n  geom_point(aes(x=Year, y=Count, color = `Transmission Type`), data=ABE, alpha = 0.35)+\n  facet_wrap(.~`Toxin Type`) + \n  theme_bw()\n\n\n\n\nThis is pretty cool! Most of the new cases for A and B are transmitted by infants with foodborne transmission nearly dying out overnight. The number of unknown types of foodborne transmission also snuffed out around the same time - I wonder if there was new food safety legislation in place that would explain the mass decrease. However, Type E remains mainly foodborne and pretty constant across time. Also with the drastic increase in infant transmission around when foodborne transmission ended I wonder if the classifications for transmission were changed. There’s no instance of “infant” transmission until 1975.\nI don’t know enough about botulism to provide more commentary, but this posed some interesting questions I’ll keep in mind if this topic arises again."
