[**Background Info:**]{.underline}

My name is Annabella Hines and I am a second year master of public health(MPH) student with a concentration in epidemiology. I graduated in December 2020 from UGA with my undergraduate degree in Biology with an emphasis in marine sciences. I then worked in a dermatopathology lab for approximately two years before returning to UGA to pursue my MPH this past fall. My main interests are in environmental epidemiology and vector borne diseases, but I'm eager to expand my knowledge in new and unexpected areas. My undergraduate research involved surveying Georgia for an invasive tick species and cataloging specimens and environmental data. My goals are to gain knowledge in Git, hone my skills in R, and become more well versed in the tools available for data analysis.
